/**
 *  Quoting standard ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft â€” April 12, 2011 N15:
 *  The strncpy function copies not more than n characters (characters that
 *  follow a null character are not copied) from the array pointed to by s2 to
 *  the array pointed to by s1. If copying takes place between objects that
 *  overlap, the behavior is undefined.
 *  If the array pointed to by s2 is a string that is shorter than n characters,
 *  null characters are appended to the copy in the array pointed to by s1,
 *  until n characters in all have been written.
 *
 *  The strncpy function returns the value of s1.
